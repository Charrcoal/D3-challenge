          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Overall, the poverty is positively related to lack of healthcare, smoke and obesity rate. 
            Low poverty rate results low lack of healthcare, in another words, the poverty limited one's ability to 
            gain acess to good healthcare. One is likely to smoke less, or became obese.</p>

          <p>There is no clear pattern between age to healthcare, smokes or obesity percentages. However, the data are
            scattered between age 34 to 42 years old in a wide range in healthcare, smokes and obese percentages. Before 
            the age 34, the smoking and obesity rate is relatively low than the rest of the populations.</p>

          <p>Opposite to poverty rate, the household income is negatively related to lack of healthcare, smoke and obesity
             rate. With higher income, healthcare become more afforadable, smoking percentage become lower, and obesity 
             rate is also lower due to the healthier lifestyle may be possible or easier to maintain.</p>
